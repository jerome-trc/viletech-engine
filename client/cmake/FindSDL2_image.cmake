FindSDL2_image
-------

Finds the SDL2_image library.

Imported Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module provides either of the following imported targets, if found:

``SDL2_image::SDL2_image``
  The shared SDL2_image library
``SDL2_image::SDL2_image-static``
  The static SDL2_image library

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will define the following variables:

``SDL2_image_FOUND``
  True if the system has the SDL2_image library.
``SDL2_image_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  Include directories needed to use SDL2_image.
``SDL2_image_LIBRARIES``
  Libraries needed to link to SDL2_image.
``SDL2_image_DLL``
  The path to the SDL2_image Windows runtime (any config).
``SDL2_image_LIBRARY``
  The path to the SDL2_image library (any config).

Cache Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following cache variables may also be set:

``SDL2_image_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The directory containing ``SDL2_image.h``.
``SDL2_image_DLL_RELEASE``
  The path to the SDL2_image Windows runtime (release config).
``SDL2_image_DLL_DEBUG``
  The path to the SDL2_image Windows runtime (debug config).
``SDL2_image_LIBRARY_RELEASE``
  The path to the SDL2_image library (release config).
``SDL2_image_LIBRARY_DEBUG``
  The path to the SDL2_image library (debug config).
