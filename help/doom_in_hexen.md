## Doom in Hexen

DSDA-Doom supports the doom-in-hexen map format, as seen in zdoom. See the things and specials [doc](./things_and_specials.md) for detailed info on what is included. In general, unless you have a particularly good reason not to, you should rather use [udmf](./udmf.md) for new projects.

The following features are not supported:

- The stand still object spawn flag
- Terrain effects (e.g., splashing lava)
- Damage types
- SNDSEQ
- ACS
- DECORATE
- ANIMDEFS
